# TRAINING UNIT 01 – System Overview: FJRC Pixel Farming

## What Is Pixel Farming?

Pixel Farming is a modular, regenerative gardening system based on 2’x2’ companion-planted garden squares called “pixels.” Each pixel is designed to be self-contained, portable, ecologically functional, and easy to install, scale, and manage.

Pixel blocks can be arranged in any space—from yards to schools to rooftops—like a living mosaic.

## Key Concepts

- **Pixel Block**: 2’x2’ modular garden bed
- **Guild**: A group of 3–5 plants selected for mutual benefit (companion planting)
- **Plant Profile**: Structured data that defines plant traits and compatibility
- **Drone Mapping**: Using aerial views to plan grid-based garden designs
- **Stewardship**: A guiding philosophy focused on participation, care, and food sovereignty

---

## Why This System Exists

- To simplify growing food at home or in community
- To restore beauty, health, and biodiversity to managed land
- To scale without industrial exploitation
- To be given away freely, as a system of shared abundance

---

## Design Principles

- **Modularity** = Simple to build and scale
- **Open Source** = Public utility, not a product
- **Data-Aware** = Trackable and improvable over time
- **Aesthetic** = Beautiful, functional, edible spaces
- **Participatory** = Teaches by doing

---

## Output Formats

- Markdown: human-readable guides and instructions
- JSON: machine-readable guilds, logs, and plant profiles
- Visuals: top-down patterns, bloom maps, layout grids
- Speech: used in AI assistants to guide stewards verbally

## Final Thought

This is not a “how to grow tomatoes” guide. It’s a **language for regenerative systems**. One block. One family. One guild at a time.

You’re not just building a garden. You’re restoring a relationship.
