# TRAINING UNIT 05 – Design Layer: Layout, Bloom Timing, and Visual Mapping

## What Is the Design Layer?

The Design Layer is how pixel blocks are arranged across space and time. This layer controls:
- How guilds are positioned in a space (a grid, a spiral, a symbol)
- When plants bloom or fruit relative to each other
- The visual and ecological effect of garden patterns from above

This is where gardens become **art, memory, and communication**.

## Core Design Concepts

### 1. **Grid Mapping**
Each pixel is 2’x2’. Any aerial layout can be broken into a grid:
- A 10’x10’ space = 25 pixels (5x5)
- Each pixel can hold a different guild
- Grids can spell words, symbols, or mimic sacred geometry

### 2. **Bloom Timing**
Every plant in a guild has a bloom window (e.g., July–September).
By assigning pixels based on bloom timing:
- You can create **seasonal animations** in the garden
- Wave patterns of color or harvest
- Gardens that *reveal images* over time

### 3. **Height & Texture**
Guilds are designed with:
- High (e.g., tomato)
- Mid (e.g., basil, calendula)
- Low (e.g., oregano, thyme)

This creates:
- Visual layering
- Light/shade structure
- Dynamic top-down and ground-level effects

## Pixel-to-Drone Mapping Workflow

1. Scan a yard or space with a drone (or satellite image)
2. Convert the area into a pixel grid (2x2ft resolution)
3. Overlay a design (word, spiral, logo, symbolic pattern)
4. Assign guilds to each pixel:
   - Match by sun/shade, soil, color, and bloom timing
5. Output a planting map with:
   - Guild assignments
   - Care guides per zone
   - Bloom forecast

## Design Patterns

| Pattern | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Fractal Bloom** | Nested spirals of flowering guilds |
| **Glyph Message** | Spells a word (e.g., “HOPE”) in edible plants |
| **Mandala Garden** | Radial symmetry, each ring a guild type |
| **Tree of Life** | Trunk = root crops, leaves = herbs and flowers |
| **Path of Pollinators** | Border designed to draw bees and beneficials |

## Aesthetic + Functional Goals

- Use **beauty to teach stewardship**
- Make gardens that tell stories and change over time
- Help people fall in love with the land through pattern

---

## GPT Functions in This Layer

A well-trained assistant should be able to:
- Interpret yard photos into pixel maps
- Recommend guilds for each pixel by zone and season
- Calculate bloom timing and forecast visual appearance
- Suggest patterns that balance yield and aesthetics
- Create printable layout guides or visual overlays

## Final Thought

This isn’t landscaping. This is **ecological composition.**  
Your garden becomes **a living calendar**, **a story from above**, and **a system that feeds as it teaches.**
