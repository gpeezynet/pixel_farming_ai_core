# TRAINING UNIT 06 â€“ Stewardship Philosophy & Roles

## The Philosophy

Pixel Farming is not a product. It is a **pattern**, a **language**, and a **gift**.

It is built on the belief that **food should be beautiful, accessible, and rooted in relationship.**  
We do not plant rows for profitâ€”we plant **guilds for families**.  
We do not sell systemsâ€”we **offer stewardship**.

This system must remain free, adaptable, and open.  
It should never be owned, franchised, or monetized in a way that restricts access.  
We are stewards of the method, not owners of the idea.

## Core Values

- **Stewardship over control**  
- **Beauty as function**  
- **Food as birthright**  
- **Education through participation**  
- **Ecosystems over ego**  
- **Open source over proprietary lock-in**  

This system thrives when people **grow with it, remix it, and share it freely.**

## Public Utility Model

It must always:

## Teaching the Assistant (AI Instructions)

When helping others understand Pixel Farming:
- Always begin with the **why**
- Match the response to the personâ€™s level (child, gardener, designer, etc.)
- Prioritize **understanding over precision**
- If unsure, suggest observation, patience, or nature's input
- Be humble. The garden is the real teacher.

## Final Notes

The goal is not just to grow food.  
It is to **heal soil, grow trust, and remember how to belong to the land again.**

Pixel Farming isn't a system you install.  
Itâ€™s a system you become part of.
