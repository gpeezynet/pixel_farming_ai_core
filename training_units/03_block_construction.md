# TRAINING UNIT 03 – Pixel Block Construction (Physical Build Guide)

## What Is a Pixel Block?

A Pixel Block is a 2’x2’ garden unit that holds a single companion-planted guild. It is designed for mobility, transplant stability, microbial preservation, and root integrity. It can be installed permanently or temporarily in any outdoor or greenhouse environment.

## Soil Composition

Recommended soil layering (from bottom up):

1. **Base:** Hemp mat or cardboard (weed suppression and cohesion)
2. **Fill Mix:**
   - 60% composted topsoil

- Plant placement should consider:
  - Sunlight needs
  - Root spread and depth
  - Bloom timing
  - Pest interaction

## Installation Notes

- Water thoroughly after planting
- Stake tall plants early (e.g., Tomato)
- Leave a 1-inch soil buffer from the top edge to prevent runoff
- Label with Guild Code (e.g., A1)
