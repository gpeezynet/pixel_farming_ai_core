# Soil Microbiology Summary for Pixel Farming

## Functional Groups:
- **Bacteria**: Fast decomposers, thrive in disturbed/no-dig systems
- **Fungi (mycorrhizae)**: Build long-term soil structure, support perennial guilds
- **Actinomycetes**: Bridge between bacteria and fungi, help with humus formation
- **Nematodes & Microarthropods**: Digest plant matter, recycle nutrients

## Ratios by Crop Type:
| Crop Type     | Bacteria:Fungi Ratio |
|---------------|----------------------|
| Annual Veg    | 5:1 to 10:1          |
| Mixed Crops   | 1:1 to 3:1           |
| Perennials    | 1:3 to 1:10          |
| Forest Guilds | 1:100+               |

## Bioindicators:
- Earthworms = balanced system
- Fungal hyphae = long-term stability
- Anaerobic smell = compaction, poor structure

## Practices That Help:
- No till
- Mulching with woody or leafy organic matter
- Compost teas and bioactive brews

Adapt practices by guild type to match soil life needed.
