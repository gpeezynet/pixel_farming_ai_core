# Research Notes on Companion Planting

## Core Principles:
- **Mutual benefit** through root layering, aroma, pest confusion
- **Biodiversity buffers** against total crop failure
- **Reduced pest pressure** through diversity and deterrents
- **Yield optimization** by stacking vertical space and growth time

## Best-Supported Pairings:
- Tomato + Basil + Marigold
- Corn + Beans + Squash (Three Sisters)
- Carrot + Chives
- Cabbage + Dill
- Onion + Lettuce

## Conflicts:
- Onion near beans (growth suppression)
- Fennel near most crops (allelopathic)

## Supporting Sources:
- ATTRA Sustainable Ag Library
- UC Davis IPM Guide
- “Carrots Love Tomatoes” (Riotte)
