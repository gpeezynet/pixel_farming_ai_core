# 🌱 FJRC Pixel Farming

**Modular. Regenerative. Open-source. Edible.**

FJRC Pixel Farming is a scalable garden system built on 2'x2' companion-planted garden blocks ("pixels") that can be grown, transplanted, tracked, and designed into intentional, living food systems.

This project contains the full structure, logic, and language of the Pixel Farming protocol—meant to serve as a public utility for families, schools, communities, and stewards of the land.

> "We grow food like we code—modular, beautiful, and built to share."

## 🧱 What Is a Pixel Block?

A **Pixel Block** is:
- A 2’x2’ grow unit (can scale up)
- Contains 3–5 companion-planted crops
- Optimized for resilience, yield, and aesthetics
- Can be grown in crates, beds, or raised platforms
- Can be tracked, mapped, and shared as a digital object

## 🌍 Why This Exists

- To restore food sovereignty at the human scale  
- To replace lawns with living systems  
- To make growing food beautiful, teachable, and joyful  
- To let AI help us design better, not control more  
- To give this system away—freely and forever
