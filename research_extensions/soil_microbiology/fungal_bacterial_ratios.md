# Fungal–Bacterial Balance & Nutrient Cycling in Living Soil  
*For Pixel Farming Applications*

---

## 🔬 Summary

Healthy soil is teeming with microbial life. Fungi and bacteria are the primary decomposers in the soil food web, and their relative abundance—the fungal-to-bacterial (F:B) ratio—directly impacts nutrient availability, soil structure, and resilience. In regenerative gardens, understanding this balance helps stewards build soil suited to different crops and guilds.

## 🧠 Core Principles

### Fungal vs. Bacterial Roles

- **Fungi**: Break down complex organic matter (lignin, cellulose); build long-distance hyphal networks; support mycorrhizal symbiosis; excellent for soil structure and carbon retention.
- **Bacteria**: Rapid decomposers of simple sugars and fresh organic inputs; cycle nitrogen; support early growth stages.

### Ratios by Soil Type

| Soil Type / Environment | F:B Ratio Estimate |
|-------------------------|--------------------|
| Forest Soil             | 5:1 or higher (fungal dominant)  
| Grassland / Pasture     | 1:1 to 3:1  
| Tilled Farmland         | 0.5:1 or lower (bacterial dominant)  
| Regenerative Garden     | Target: 1:1 to 2:1 for mixed annuals  
| Pixel Root Guilds       | Up to 3:1  
| Pixel Leafy/Greens      | Closer to 1:1  

- **Acidic soils** favor fungi  
- **Alkaline soils** favor bacteria  
- **Disturbance (tillage, fertilizers)** tilts bacterial dominance

## 🧪 Feeding the Soil Microbiome

| Input Type         | Effect on Microbes          |
|--------------------|-----------------------------|
| Fresh green matter | Boosts bacteria             |
| Wood chips/straw   | Boosts fungi                |
| Compost tea        | Balanced boost              |
| Leaf mold/forest soil | Fungal inoculant        |
| KNF/JADAM inputs   | Reintroduce local biology   |

## 🌱 Application to Pixel Farming

### Pre-Planting Prep

- Mix 4–8 liters (~1–2") of mature compost into a 2’x2’ bed
- Fork lightly; do not till
- Add a handful of forest soil or leaf mold for fungal colonization
- Optional: Dust roots with powdered mycorrhizal fungi during planting

### Inoculation Timing

- At transplant: Dust rootballs or seed holes
- Mid-season: Water with compost tea (brewed 12–24 hrs, optionally aerated)
- Add JADAM liquid fertilizer or KNF inoculants as foliar or root drench

### Living Root Systems

- Plant quick cover crops (clover, buckwheat) post-harvest
- Keep roots in soil to feed microbes (don’t rip plants out—cut at base)
- Avoid bare soil: mulch with straw, shredded leaves, or green chop

### Mulching for Microbes

| Climate        | Mulch Type          | Benefit                        |
|----------------|---------------------|-------------------------------|
| Temperate      | Straw, leaves       | Fungal boost, winter insulation  
| Arid           | Woody mulch, shaded | Retains moisture, fungi-friendly  
| Tropical       | Thin green mulch    | Rapid decomposition, balance

## 🌍 Climate-Specific Tips

- **Tropical Zones**: Mulch heavily; add compost often to prevent leaching  
- **Arid Zones**: Use fungal-favoring mulch + micro-irrigators (ollas, pipes)  
- **Temperate**: Straw mulch in winter; spring compost tea revival  
- **Cold**: Keep beds insulated, some fungi stay active under straw

## 🚫 What to Avoid

- Tillage or deep digging → breaks fungal hyphae  
- Chemical fertilizers (esp. nitrogen) → boost bacteria, suppress fungi  
- Bare soil → kills microbial colonies with UV and desiccation  
- Fungicides / soil sterilants → wipes out beneficial soil life

## 🧭 Cultural + Traditional Practices

- **Indigenous American techniques** left most soil undisturbed  
- **KNF**: Uses IMO collections (forest soil + rice) to reintroduce wild fungi  
- **JADAM**: Builds liquid fertilizer + microbe ferments at home scale  
- **Indian Natural Farming**: Treats soil as a living being (emphasis on roots + microbes)  
- **Permaculture**: Sees microbes as “primary crops” → feed them first
