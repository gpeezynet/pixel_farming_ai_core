# Guild Interactions by Climate Zone  
*Compiled for Pixel Farming – Plant Guild Science*

## 🌿 Climate Zone: Temperate (USDA Zones 5–7)  
### Guild Name: Brassica Shield Guild  
**Primary Purpose:** Pest Control (allelochemic & trap cropping)  
**Garden Format:** Flat bed (open-row or block planting)

**Plants:**
- **Cabbage** – Main food crop (leafy head)
- **Chamomile** – Masking scent & soil health booster
- **Thyme** – Aromatic ground cover + culinary herb
- **Nasturtium** – Trap crop with edible flowers

**Why It Works:**  
Chamomile and thyme mask brassica scent and enrich soil. Nasturtiums act as aphid magnets and protect the cabbage. Thyme creeps and deters pests while suppressing weeds. Each plant plays a role in defense and enrichment.

**Cultural Note:**  
European cottage gardens historically used chamomile as a “physician plant” and nasturtiums as edible pest buffers.

## 🌞 Climate Zone: Subtropical (USDA Zones 8–10)  
### Guild Name: Tomato & Basil Protective Guild  
**Primary Purpose:** Food Production + Pest Suppression  
**Garden Format:** Raised bed (deep soil)

**Plants:**
- **Tomato** – Vertical fruit crop
- **Basil** – Pest deterrent and flavor booster
- **French Marigold** – Nematode deterrent and aphid attractor
- **Pole Bean** – Nitrogen fixer and climbing companion

**Why It Works:**  
Basil repels whiteflies and improves tomato yield. Marigolds deter root pests and attract aphid predators. Beans fix nitrogen and climb tomato supports, benefiting from partial shade.

**Cultural/Scientific Note:**  
Mediterranean traditions meet research—basil improves tomato growth; marigolds protect roots; beans cycle nitrogen. Timed seeding prevents overcrowding.

## 🌵 Climate Zone: Arid / Semi-Arid (Mediterranean)  
### Guild Name: Mediterranean Dry Herb Guild  
**Primary Purpose:** Medicinal & Pollinator Support  
**Garden Format:** Border Edge or Raised Bed with rock mulch

**Plants:**
- **Rosemary** – Evergreen structural herb, backdrop
- **Lavender** – Pollinator magnet, drought-tolerant
- **Sage** – Sacred herb, repels insects
- **Creeping Thyme** – Ground cover + aromatic mulch

**Why It Works:**  
These herbs thrive in dry conditions and require little water. Their layered planting traps heat while shielding the soil. Strong scents deter pests and support beneficials. Shared fungal networks support drought tolerance.

**Cultural Note:**  
Reflects monastic gardens and herbalist traditions. Mediterranean cultures used these herbs for medicine, food, and ritual. Mycorrhizal sharing boosts resilience.

## 🌴 Climate Zone: Tropical (USDA Zones 11+)  
### Guild Name: Micro Banana Circle Guild  
**Primary Purpose:** Food Production + Soil Building  
**Garden Format:** Round raised bed with compost pit

**Plants:**
- **Dwarf Banana** – Main fruit crop, top canopy
- **Papaya** – Fast sub-canopy fruiter
- **Sweet Potato** – Living mulch, ground cover + tuber
- **Taro** – Root crop near compost core
- **Lemongrass** – Border herb + pest repellent + soil binder

**Why It Works:**  
Bananas and papayas shade soil and feed heavily from compost. Taro and sweet potato fill lower layers and retain moisture. Lemongrass repels insects and prevents erosion. Compost pit creates a self-fertilizing system.

**Cultural Note:**  
South Pacific and tropical Indigenous agroforestry system. Compost-centered design turns waste into nutrition. Shared planting + pruning = a living jungle guild. Known as a micro food forest.

## 🪴 Zone-Neutral Future Notes  
- These guilds can be adapted into raised beds, crate pixels, or school gardens.  
- Vertical stacking is central: light, roots, and bloom timing must sync.  
- More climate zones and “extreme weather” guilds to be added soon.
